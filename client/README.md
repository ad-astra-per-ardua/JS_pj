## Branch name rules

-  Please ensure that your branch names adhere to the naming convention specified by the regex pattern: (feature|publish|release|hotfix|develop|main)/[a-z0-9._-]+$. 
-  This means that all branch names should start with one of the prefixes 'feature', 'publish', 'release', 'hotfix', 'develop', or 'main', followed by a forward slash and then any combination of lowercase letters, numbers, dots, underscores, or hyphens.
